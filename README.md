**Project Download:**

I couldn’t upload the project to GitHub, even when I tried to export the project as an asset package (also Unity said I had been using too many assets to keep track of in order to export the package). However, I do want to see the project in my GitHub repository so I will try to upload again.

## The World:

# Welcome to Erojir!

- Erojir is a densely forested world whose wildlife have bioluminescent qualities in various shades of blue, purple and green. It has a rich flora that homes an immense amount of wildlife. The various natural environments of Erojir are protected by Guardians, sacred beings created by Mother Nature to nurture the planet and care for the creatures living in it. They are also entrusted with maintaining the orbs of life, which are the sources of life for the environments.
- This world is also the home of humanoids that have, for years been divided in two factions: the Sajir, who believe in the divinity of Mother Nature and maintaining the natural balance of the world, and the Ajk’in who believe in the godliness of Kanw’ar (Knowledge). These last faction has pursued knowledge through magic, a power that is fueled by the vital energy of the world and which has provided them with an easier life full of commodities . Thus, in their search of acquiring knowledge, the Ajk’in have sacrificed the fauna and flora of Erojir to maintain their leisurely life and honor the teaching of the God of Knowledge.
    
    ### **The Main Participants**:
    
    - **The Guardians:** Guardians protect nature. Each Guardian is in charge of the well being and protection of their own realm (natural systems). For example, some of them protect springs, forests, rivers, etc. Since they are the ones who proects the biomes's "orb of life", or the source of the power/energy, the Ajk'in seek to destroy them to exploit these asset that the  biomes have.
    - **The Ajk'in:** They use the energy of nature to generate magic, which gives them power and fuel their villages.They seek to destroy the environment to sustain their lifestyle. For this purpose, some Ajk’in specialize in destruction magic that can kill Guardians and leave the realms unprotected for them to take over.  (Because of the high energy resource required to perform this type of magic, these Ajk'in look like skeletons since the rest of their body has been used for the production of this magic. That is why they call themselves Skeleton Warlock)
    
    ### **The Sya'nir Forest**
    
    The area of Erojir that my project focuses on is the heart of the Sya’nir Forest (The Great Forest). The forest is protected by the Guardian Chir (Rose) and is one of the most vital parts of this world because of its connection to a spring which is the main source of water of the region. Chir inhabits this spring were the Sajir have constructed a small monument in their honor and lives peacefully along the animals that reside in Sya’nir.
    
    Nearby, a village of Ajk’in has just settle and had sent a Skeleton Warlock to destroy Chir in order to extract the life force of the forest to power their settlement.
    
    The user lands on this part of the Sya’nir forest just before the attack of the Warlock.
    

Fun Fact: all of the names for this project are derived from the indegenous languages of Chorti, Lenca and Misquito which are native of my country Honduras

## Visual and user experience

The player is dropped off in the **Sya'nir Forest** just before the Skeleton Warlock attacks. They can see the forest in all of its splendor right before it is altered by the Ajk'in. The user is able to see both the wizard attacking and how the shrine is taken down. 

 I tried to emphasize the mysticality of nature through the neon accents and use the shrine as a way to convey the idea that this is a scared or important world as the rocks look intentionally placecd that way. Additionally, I wanted it to look like the Ajk'in was attacking the user when in fact they were aiming at te guardian. 

I wanted the precense of the threat (the Ajk'in) to somewhat of a surprise fact, thus I wanted to put accents (the particles) in the peripherals of the user's view in order to attract the user's curiosity and giving them a sense of wonder rather than of caution. Thus, through those accents, I hoped to make my environment as interesting as possible to invoke the curiosity of the player in order for them to turn around their head enough to see that there is actually a menance behind them that will affect that environment severely. At the same time, I am aware that some people might not find the space that interesting, which is why I decided to use a particle animation for the Ajk'in in order for the user to assume that there might be something behind them, while at the same time changing the whole lightning of the environment and the orb of light

## Reflection:

### Process:

My whole process can be summarized in these two pages I made for the purpose of organizing the steps to take to give my vision life.

**Initial look**: Here I was experimenting with the layout of the place. I mainly positioned assets to see how big they were and how I would like to see them organize. In many ways this helped me create the flow of the space.

### Challenges:

- Most of the models I wanted to use did not have materials compatible with the Universal PL, so I had to manually do them. For most (if not all, literally) of the assets I used, I had to create the materials, toy around with the values and experiment until they had the look I wanted. I also did that with most of the luminescent objects. It was very exhausting and it took a lot of my time, however I do like the overall look of my project.
- Assets that where too small or too far away sometimes appeared pink even in the game view despite the fact that they were compatible with the Universal Pipeline. Thus, I had to be more strategic with where I placed some of the plants rather than using the polybrush more freely.
- The animations of the fairy where done as Legendar animations, nowadays Unity's default is Mecanim, so I couldn't do the part of the fairy actually dying because I would have to make the avatar for the model it took too much time (I started it but had to give up on the idea).
- At one point early on, I couldn't deform the landscape using the polybrush but professor Allison fixed it.
- I actually wanted to make trigger animations instead of just using the timeline, however, due to lack of time and my unfamiliarity with C#, the process was quiet challenging and I didn't got a much done as I would have wanted to. Once I saw that the fairy would not be able to die (what a horrible thing to say hahaha), I decided to experiment with other stuff. Since the timeline can be run simultaneously with the individual animations of objects outside the timeline, I decided to make a timeline for the attack and have the fairy perform her idle animation throughout the experience.
- I really wanted to change the actual skybox of the project in order to get that nice contrast f the environment before and after the attack, however it was a little complicated for me since that consisted of many if statements and listing the skyboxes rather than referencing them directly. Thus, I decided to see if I could make an animator for the directed light instead and that gave me a nice transition between the normal environment and the threatedned one, however I do think that the skyboxes offer a better finish.
- The audio that I was initially using sounded distorted. I had to download an audio asset t fix this.
- When you move the order of objects in the hierarchy, stuff gets messed up.
- I had to load the particles for the project last because it slowed down my computer too much and it made the loading of the game view a pain.
- The free version I downloaded for the Ajk'in wizard did not include the animation that I originally wanted to use. ;-;
- GitHub. Need I say more?

### For improvement:

- Try to improve at C# and using trigger animations
- Improving the sound quality of the project + adding sound effects
- I think I can do more with the lighting. I really enjoyed using the particles and would like to see how other features can work in-game.
- Better organization of the Unity asset folder. (I don't like the failinf system for this project)
- Before actually starting to do the project, I think it would be good to dedicate the first part into researching how to do stuff rather than jumping right on and loosing time on things that could have been done in an easier way.
- Make it more aesthetic (maybe playing with what happens during the attack more).
- Adding cut scenes (I wanted to make one that included a camera rotation but I opted for something else instead. I left the start in the project however, just in case I try that out later).
- Be more efficient with the usage of space: I was so concerned about having gaps in my space that I ended up doing a terrain bigger than necessary and placing assets in positions that I feel were not really adding to the scenery the way I wanted them to.
- There was a lot of organizing and re-organizing of things in this project (which was challenging since I still wanted it to look natural in a sort of way) but I really like that, specially placing details and accents. I want to be more experimental next time with this aspect.

### Conclusion:

I really enjoyed this project. I love world building and I really want to get better at it and see my vision come to life. I am also very happy with the overall look of the forest. If I had more time I would really want to go for more sophisticated interactions with the animations and to change the skybox instead of the directed light. 

It was fun. I'm looking forward to seen this space in the Oculust Quest.
